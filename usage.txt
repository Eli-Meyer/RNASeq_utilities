-------------------------
CombineExpression.pl
-------------------------

Combines expression data (counts) produced by mapping multiple
samples against a shared database.
Usage: CombineExpression.pl file1 file2 .. fileN >output.tab
	output.tab: 	Name of output file (rows=genes, columns=samples)

-------------------------
CountByComponent.pl
-------------------------

Filters alignments produced by SHRiMP's gmapper and probcalc to exclude weak or short,
partial matches based on user specified criteria.
If your reference is a Trinity de novo assembly, this script may be appropriate.
Ambiguous mapping is evaluated at the level of components: if a read matches two sequences
from the same component, that read is counted. If a read matches two sequences from different
components, that read is discarded.

Usage: CountByComponent.pl input_alignments min_matching min_align output_counts
Where: input_alignments:	input file, the output from gmapper -> probcalc.
	min_matching:		Minimum number of matching bases required in each alignment.
	min_align:		Minimum length of each alignment required.
	output_counts:		A name for the output file documenting coverage for each reference sequence.

-------------------------
CountBySubcomponent.pl
-------------------------

Filters alignments produced by SHRiMP's gmapper and probcalc to exclude weak or short,
partial matches based on user specified criteria.
If your reference is a Trinity de novo assembly, this script may be appropriate.
Ambiguous mapping is evaluated at the level of subcomponents: if a read matches two sequences
from the same subcomponent, that read is counted. If a read matches two sequences from different
subcomponents, that read is discarded.

Usage: CountBySubcomponent.pl input_alignments min_matching min_align output_counts
Where: input_alignments:	input file, the output from gmapper -> probcalc.
	min_matching:		Minimum number of matching bases required in each alignment.
	min_align:		Minimum length of each alignment required.
	output_counts:		A name for the output file documenting coverage for each reference sequence.

-------------------------
GmapperFilter.pl
-------------------------

Filters alignments produced by SHRiMP's gmapper and probcalc to exclude
weak or short, partial matches based on user specified criteria.
Ambiguous mapping is evaluated at the level of sequences in your reference.
If a read matches two sequences equally well, that read is discarded.

Usage: GmapperFilter.pl input_alignments min_matching min_align output_alignments output_counts
Where: input_alignments:	input file, the output from gmapper -> probcalc.
	min_matching:		Minimum number of matching bases required in each alignment.
	min_align:		Minimum length of each alignment required.
	output_alignments:	A name for the output file containing all alignments passing the above criteria.
	(This file is further processed for 2bRAD genotyping)
	output_counts:		A name for the output file documenting coverage for each reference sequence.
	(This file is used for RNASeq gene expression analysis)
