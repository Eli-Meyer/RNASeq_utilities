This repository contains a series of scripts used for our standard analysis of gene 
expression using 3' tag-based cDNA libraries (RNA-Seq).
You'll also need the "sequence utilities" and "sequence processing" repositories.

The usage information for each script (usage.txt) can be reproduced by running each script without arguments.

Any questions or bugs? Please contact Eli Meyer: eli.meyer@science.oregonstate.edu.
